Normal Moveout (NMO) Correction
===============================

This example shows how to create your own operator for performing
normal moveout (NMO) correction to a seismic record.
We will perform classic NMO using an operator created from scratch,
as well as using the :py:class:`pylops.Spread` operator.

# Given a common-shot or common-midpoint (CMP) record, the objective of NMO
# correction is to "flatten" events, that is, align events at later offsets
# to that of the zero offset. NMO has long been a staple of seismic data
# processing, used even today for initial velocity analysis and QC purposes.
# In addition, it can be the domain of choice for many useful processing
# steps, such as angle muting.
#
# To get started, let us create a 2D seismic dataset containing some hyperbolic
# events representing reflections from flat reflectors.
# Events are created with a true RMS velocity, which we will be using as if we
# picked them from, for example, a semblance panel.

# NMO correction consists of applying an offset- and time-dependent shift to
# each sample of the trace in such a way that all events corresponding to the
# same reflection will be located at the same time intercept after correction.
#
# An arbitrary hyperbolic event at position :math:`(t, h)` is linked to its
# zero-offset traveltime :math:`t_0` by the following equation
#
# .. math::
#     t(x) = \sqrt{t_0^2 + \frac{h^2}{v_\text{rms}^2(t_0)}}
#
# Our strategy in applying the correction is to loop over our time axis
# (which we will associate to :math:`t_0`) and respective RMS velocities
# and, for each offset, move the sample at :math:`t(x)` to location
# :math:`t_0(x) \equiv t_0`. In the figure above, we are considering a
# single :math:`t_0 = 0.5\mathrm{s}` which would have values along the dotted curve
# (i.e., :math:`t(x)`) moved to :math:`t_0` for every offset.
#
# Notice that we need NMO velocities for each sample of our time axis.
# In this example, we actually only have 3 samples, when we need ``nt`` samples.
# In practice, we would have many more samples, but probably not one for each
# ``nt``. To resolve this issue, we will interpolate these 3 samples to all samples
# of our time axis (or, more accurately, their slownesses to preserve traveltimes).

# NMO from scratch
# ----------------
# We are very close to building our NMO correction, we just need to take care of
# one final issue. When moving the sample from :math:`t(x)` to :math:`t_0`, we
# know that, by definition, :math:`t_0` is always on our time axis grid. In contrast,
# :math:`t(x)` may not fall exactly on a multiple of ``dt`` (our time axis
# sampling). Suppose its nearest sample smaller than itself (floor) is ``i``.
# Instead of moving only sample `i`, we will be moving samples both samples
# ``i`` and ``i+1`` with an appropriate weight to account for how far
# :math:`t(x)` is from ``i*dt`` and ``(i+1)*dt``.

# NMO using :py:class:`pylops.Spread`
# -----------------------------------
# We learned how to implement an NMO correction and its adjoint from scratch.
# The adjoint has an interesting pattern, where energy taken from one domain
# is "spread" along a previously-defined parametric curve (the NMO hyperbola
# in this case). This pattern is very common in many algorithms, including
# Radon transform, Kirchhoff migration (also known as Total Focusing Method in
# ultrasonics) and many others.
#
# For these classes of operators, PyLops offers a :py:class:`pylops.Spread`
# constructor, which we will leverage to implement a version of the NMO correction.
# The :py:class:`pylops.Spread` operator will take a value in the "input" domain,
# and spread it along a parametric curve, defined in the "output" domain.
# In our case, the spreading operation is the *adjoint* of the NMO, so our
# "input" domain is the NMO domain, and the "output" domain is the original
# data domain.
#
# In order to use :py:class:`pylops.Spread`, we need to define the
# parametric curves. This can be done through the use of a table with shape
# :math:`(n_{x_i}, n_{t}, n_{x_o})`, where :math:`n_{x_i}` and :math:`n_{t}`
# represent the 2d dimensions of the "input" domain (NMO domain) and :math:`n_{x_o}`
# and :math:`n_{t}` the 2d dimensions of the "output" domain. In our NMO case,
# :math:`n_{x_i} = n_{x_o} = n_h` represents the number of offsets.
# Following the documentation of :py:class:`pylops.Spread`, the table will be
# used in the following manner:
#
#     ``d_out[ix_o, table[ix_i, it, ix_o]] += d_in[ix_i, it]``
#
# In our case, ``ix_o = ix_i = ih``, and comparing with our NMO adjoint, ``it``
# refers to :math:`t_0` while ``table[ix, it, ix]`` should then provide the
# appropriate index for :math:`t(x)`. In our implementation we will also be
# constructing a second table containing the weights to be used for linear
# interpolation.

# Not as blazing fast as out original implementation, but pretty good (try the

# NMO will always have a speed disadvantage. While iterating over the table, it must
# loop over the offsets twice: one for the "input" offsets and one for the "output"
# offsets. We know they are the same for NMO, but since ``Spread`` is a generic
# operator, it does not know that. So right off the bat we can expect an 80x
# slowdown (nh = 80). We diminished this cost to about 30x by setting values where
# ``ix_i != ix_o`` to NaN, but nothing beats the custom implementation. Despite this,
# we can still produce the same result to numerical accuracy:
