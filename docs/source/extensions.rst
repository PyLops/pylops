Extensions
==========

PyLops brings to users the power of linear operators in a simple and easy
to use programming interface.

While very powerful on its own, this library is further extended to take
advantage of more advanced computational resources, either in terms of
**multiple-node clusters** or **GPUs**. Moreover, some indipendent small
libraries are created to use third party softwares that cannot be included as
dependencies to our main library for licensing issues but may be useful
for academic purposes.

Spin-off projects that aim at extending the capabilities of PyLops are:

* `PyLops-GPU <https://github.com/equinor/pylops-gpu>`_
* `PyLops-Distributed <https://github.com/equinor/pylops-distributed>`_
* `curvelops <https://github.com/cako/curvelops>`_
