.. _performance:

Advanced installation
=====================

In this section we discuss some *important details* regarding code performance when
using PyLops.

To get the most out of PyLops operators in terms of speed you will need
to follow these guidelines as much as possible or ensure that the Python libraries
used by PyLops are efficiently installed (e.g., allow multithreading) in your systemt.


Dependencies
------------

PyLops relies on the `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ and
`scipy <http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html>`_ libraries and being able to
link these to the most performant `BLAS <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms>`_
will ensure optimal performance of PyLops when using only *required dependencies*.

As already mentioned in the :ref:`installation` page, we strongly encourage using
the `Anaconda Python distribution <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_ as
*numpy* and *scipy* will be automatically linked to the ``Intel MKL``
library, which is per today the most performant library for basic linear algebra
operations (if you don't believe it, take a read at this
`blog post <http://markus-beuckelmann.de/blog/boosting-numpy-blas.html>`_).

The best way to understand which ``BLAS`` library is currently linked to your
*numpy* and *scipy* libraries is to run the following commands in ipython:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   import scipy as sp
   print(np.__config__.show())
   print(scipy.__config__.show())


You should be able to understand if your *numpy* and *scipy* are
linked to ``Intel MKL`` or something else.

.. note::
    Unfortunately, PyLops is so far only shipped with `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`_, meaning that if you
    have not already installed *numpy* and *scipy*  in your environment they will be installed as
    part of the installation process of the *pylops* library, all of those using ``pip``. This comes with
    the disadvantage that *numpy* and *scipy* are linked to ``OpenBlas`` instead of ``Intel MKL``,
    leading to a loss of performance. To prevent this, we suggest the following strategy:

    * create conda environment, e.g. ``conda create -n envname python=3.6.4 numpy scipy``
    * install pylops using ``pip install pylops``

Finally, it is always important to make sure that your environment variable ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` is
correctly set to the maximum number of threads you would like to use in your code. If that is not the
case *numpy* and *scipy* will underutilize your hardware even if linked to a performant ``BLAS`` library.

For example, first set ``OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`` (single-threaded) in your terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1

and run the following code in python:

.. code-block:: python

   import os
   import numpy as np
   from timeit import timeit

   size = 4096
   A = np.random.random((size, size)),
   B = np.random.random((size, size))
   print('Time with %s threads: %f s' \
         %(os.environ.get('OMP_NUM_THREADS'),
           timeit(lambda: np.dot(A, B), number=4)))

Subsequently set ``OMP_NUM_THREADS=2``, or any higher number of threads available
in your hardware (multi-threaded):

.. code-block:: bash

   >> export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2

and run the same python code. By both looking at your processes (e.g. using ``top``) and at the
python print statement you should see a speed-up in the second case.

Alternatively, you could set the ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` variable directly
inside your script using ``os.environ['OMP_NUM_THREADS']=str(2)``.
Moreover, note that when using ``Intel MKL`` you can alternatively set
the ``MKL_NUM_THREADS`` instead of ``OMP_NUM_THREADS``: this could
be useful if your code runs other parallel processes which you can
control indipendently from the ``Intel MKL`` ones using ``OMP_NUM_THREADS``.

.. note::
    Always remember to set ``OMP_NUM_THREADS`` (or ``MKL_NUM_THREADS``)
    in your enviroment when using PyLops


Optional dependencies
---------------------
To avoid increasing the number of *required* dependencies, which may lead to conflicts with
other libraries that you have in your system, we have decided to build some of the additional features
of PyLops in such a way that if an *optional* dependency is not present in your python environment,
a safe fallback to one of the required dependencies will be enforced.

When available in your system, we reccomend using the Conda package manager and install all the
mandatory and optional dependencies of PyLops at once using the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> conda install -c conda-forge pylops

in this case all dependencies will be installed from their conda distributions.

Alternatively, from version ``1.4.0`` optional dependencies can also be installed as
part of the pip installation via:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> pip install pylops[advanced]

Dependencies are however installed from their PyPI wheels.


numba
~~~~~
Although we always stive to write code for forward and adjoint operators that takes advantage of
the perks of numpy and scipy (e.g., broadcasting, ufunc), in some case we may end up using for loops
that may lead to poor performance. In those cases we may decide to implement alternative (optional)
back-ends in `numba <http://numba.pydata.org>`_.

In this case a user can simply switch from the native,
always available implementation to the numba implementation by simply providing the following
additional input parameter to the operator ``engine='numba'``. This is for example the case in the
:py:class:`pylops.signalprocessing.Radon2D`.

If interested to use ``numba`` backend from conda, you will need to manually install it:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> conda install numba

Finally, it is also advised to install the additional package
`icc_rt <http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/performance-tips.html?highlight=icc_rt>`_.

.. code-block:: bash

   >> conda install -c numba icc_rt

or pip equivalent. Similarly to ``Intel MKL``, you need to set the environment variable
``NUMBA_NUM_THREADS`` to tell numba how many threads to use.


fft routines
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Two different *engines* are provided by the :py:class:`pylops.signalprocessing.FFT` operator for
``fft`` and ``ifft`` routines in the forward and adjoint modes: ``engine='numpy'`` (default)
and ``engine='fftw'``.

The first engine comes as default as numpy is part of the dependencies
of PyLops and automatically installed when PyLops is installed if not already available
in your Python distribution.

The second engine implements the well-known `FFTW <http://www.fftw.org>`_
via the python wrapper :py:class:`pyfftw.FFTW`. This optimized fft tends to
outperform the one from numpy in many cases, however it has not been inserted
in the mandatory requirements of PyLops, meaning that when installing PyLops with
``pip``, :py:class:`pyfftw.FFTW` will *not* be installed automatically.

Again, if interested to use ``FFTW`` backend from conda, you will need to manually install it:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> conda install -c conda-forge pyfftw

or pip equivalent.

skfmm
~~~~~
This library is used to compute traveltime tables with the fast-marching method in the
initialization of the :py:class:`pylops.waveeqprocessing.Demigration` operator
when choosing ``mode == 'eikonal'``.

As this may not be of interest for many users, this library has not been inserted
in the mandatory requirements of PyLops. If interested to use ``skfmm``,
you will need to manually install it:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> conda install -c conda-forge scikit-fmm

or pip equivalent.

spgl1
~~~~~
This library is used to solve sparsity-promoting BP, BPDN, and LASSO problems
in :py:func:`pylops.optimization.sparsity.SPGL1` solver.

If interested to use ``spgl1``, you can manually install it:

.. code-block:: bash

   >> pip install spgl1


.. note:: If you are a developer, all the optional dependencies can also be
   installed automatically by cloning the repository and installing
   pylops via ``make dev-install`` or ``make dev-install_conda``.
